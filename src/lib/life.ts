/* A game's lifetime, so nothing it scheduled outlives it.
 *
 * Most games move on with a timer: a right answer, a pause to enjoy it, then
 * the next word is shown and spoken. Leave the game inside that pause and a
 * bare setTimeout still fires, so the next word was being said over the home
 * screen, a win fanfare played to nobody, and a microphone could open after
 * the game that asked for it had gone.
 *
 * So each game takes one of these when it mounts, schedules through it, and
 * ends it when it unmounts. Anything async checks `alive()` when it wakes. */
